## Defining MongoDB
- ==MongoDB==: a NoSQL Database
	- ==NoSQL==: "Not Only SQL"
		- When a database is **NoSQL**, it means that a database does support a structured query langauge (SQL)
		- However, there is more flexibility in the storage of the data other than just basic tabular storage (e.g., MySQL)
		- In a **NoSQL** database, every piece of data is unaware of the other pieces
		- Focuses on speed while having little to no need of relationships between tables
- In **MongoDB** there are no **Joins**
		- Joins are an expensive operation
		- MongoDB focuses on speed
- In **MongoDB** everything is stored as a JSON object
	- This is the reason why MongoDB is a quintessential part of the **MEAN** / **MERN** stack
