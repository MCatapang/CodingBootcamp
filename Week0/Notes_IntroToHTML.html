    <h1>Heading Tags: denote the heading for your webpage</h1>
    <p>Paragraph Tag: identifies the paragraph in your webpage.</p>

    <a>Anchor tags are used for links, and they can be used with either text or images.</a>
        <a href="https://www.google.com">This is the sentence that'll link you to your Absolute URL denoted by the "href" attribute</a>
        <a href="https://www.google.com"><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2f/Google_2015_logo.svg/1200px-Google_2015_logo.svg.png"></a>
        <a href="AnotherFileInWebsite.html">You're not limited to just using Absolut URLs as values in your "href" attributes â€“ you can also use a Relative URL that points to another file within a website.</a>
        <a href="#top">You can also use Anchor URLs as the values inside your href attributes, so you can link text to an anchor inside your webpage.</a>
    
    <p>There are two types of HTML lists: Ordered Lists and Unordered Lists.</p>
        <ol>
                <li>Ordered Lists are numbered.</li>
                <li>This is an example.</li>
        </ol>
        <ul>
                <li>Unordered Lists are just bullet points.</li>
                <li>This is another example of them.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <p>Tables can be used to display information. Because of how tables are made up of many different parts, there are many tags associated with a table.
        <table>
            <thead><!--tag denoting which portion of the code is the Table Header-->
                <tr><!--tag denoting a new table row-->
                    <th>Name</th><!--the "th" tag denotes that "Name" is the name for the first header-->
                    <th>Age</th>
                    <th>Location</th>
                </tr>
            </thead>
            <tbody><!--Tag denoting the portion of the code for the Table Body-->    
                </tr><!--Second row (technically speaking) and can be considered the first row for the body-->
                    <td>Michael Angelo</td><!--the "td" tag denotes that "Michael Angelo" is the data for the first body row's "Name" column-->
                    <td>Twenty-Three (23)</td>
                    <td>Irvine, California</td>
                </tr>
            </tbody>
        </table>
