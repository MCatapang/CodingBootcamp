# JavaScript OOP
---
##### Functional Programming Style
- JavaScript utilizes a functional programming style
	- `Class`es aren't a core part of the JS language
	- JS isn't inherently object-oriented
- OOP style of programming can still be utilized in JS however
	- E.g., pairing JS objects and `function`s to create `constructor`s
- As such, it's very important to understand OOP to understand the purpose of constructors in JS
