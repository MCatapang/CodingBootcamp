##### Defining React
- **React**: a JavaScript library for building user interfaces
- It's the code that'll be ran on our user's browser

##### Why Learn React
- **Single Page Application (SPA)**: a web app consisting of one webpage that dynamically changes
	- React can be used to build an SPA
- React isn't opinionated about what technology we use it with
	- We can choose the library for https requests
	- We can choose the library for front-end routing
	- We can choose the library for styling
	- Etc.
- React doesn't prevent us from using DOM manipulation already built into JavaScript
- React is popular
	- React has more weekly downloads on NPM for React than for Angular or Vue
