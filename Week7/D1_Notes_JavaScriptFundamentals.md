# JavaScript Fundamentals
---------------- 
###### Why JavaScript
+ JavaScript is widespread (e.g., Google auto-complete, in-browser chat apps, etc.)
+ a language that more developers can understand than any other language
+ one of the [[#Big Three Languages]]


##### Features
- JavaScript is an interpreted language
	- at runtime, an interpreter parses the Javascript we wrote and turns it into machine code for the computer
- JavaScript is an event-driven programming language
	- e.g., `onclick` , `onhover`, etc.
- JavaScript is run on a single thread
	- commands are ran one at a time â€“ never concurrently withone another


##### Big Three Languages
1. **HTML**: the skeleton of a webpage
	- its elements are first placed into the DOM so that data can be represented in the browser
2. **CSS**: the style and positioning of HTML elements
3. **JavaScript**: the behavior of the website
	- dynamically manipulates the DOM to make the website interactive
