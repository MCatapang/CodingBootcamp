/* CSS Resets */
    /* basic details */
        /* Different browsers may give default attributes to HTML elements, causing sites to look different based on the version of the browser or whether you're seeing the site in IE, Firefox, Chrome, etc.  
        For example in Internet Explorer, an H1 element may have certain margin and padding causing your site to look one way, while Chrome and Firefox may give the H1 a slightly different margin/padding.  These differences can cause a headache, especially if you're trying to make your site look consistent throughout different browsers/versions. */
        /* To solve many cross-browser issues, it's encouraged that you use 'RESET' and 'NORMALIZE' (discussed below) and, basically, define what the default attributes should be (instead of relying on the default values that come with the browser).  
        In fact, technical recruiters love to ask you about this and see if you know how to make your site look consistent throughout different browsers.  When they ask you this, you should be able to explain (with confidence) what reset/normalizing means and why they are used.  You should also tell them that in addition to this, it's important to validate your HTML/CSS often, as validating the HTML/CSS gives insight on how you can fix issues that may lead to cross-browser compatibility issues (and often, invalid HTML/CSS can lead to weird behavior as the browser may not 'fix' invalid HTML/CSS quite the right way). */

        /* the simplest css reset that web devs use is to zero out the margin and padding */
            * {
                padding: 0;
                margin: 0;
            }
