# Algorithms

## Importance of Algorithms
- Widely used in coding interviews
    - Extremely important in order to get a job
- Useful even without even using code, because it shows your thought process and logical thinking
- Getting the right answer isn't always the most important part, (but still important).
- Algorithms can help us become more fluent in a language.
- **Language Agnostic** for the most part
    - Still important to note that different language present the algorithms in different ways

## Practice Resources
- Codewars
- Leetcode
- CodingDojo Algorithm App

## Morning Algorithm Sessions
- Not graded, thus not required to graduate
- Group work
    - As a way of learning how to collaborate

## T-Charts
- T-Chart: variables and values
    - Models what's happening as the program runs
