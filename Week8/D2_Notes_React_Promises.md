## Defining Promises
- ==Promise==: a promise is a pattern where the eventual response (and how long it will take to receive it) is not known
- Promises have 3 states:
	1. ==Pending==: the outcome is not yet determined
	2. ==Resolved==: the outcome is completed successfully
	3. ==Rejected==: the outcome is completed with errors
