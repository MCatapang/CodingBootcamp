# My SQL Checklist

## 1. Start the MySQL server from your System Preferences.
- There should be a new category at the very bottom named ***MySQL***.

## 2. Create a MySQL alias for terminal connection.
- (Verify if this is just a one time thing or an everytime thing)

## 3. Connect to MySQL Shell via terminal
- Run the following code in your terminal:
    ```
    mysql -uroot -p
    ```
- Doing so will connect you to the MySQL Shell
